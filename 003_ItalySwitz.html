 <h1>Italy and Switzerland 2019</h1>
  <h2>The Highest Hights</h2>
  <p> Our biggest adventure of all, a friend and I flew to Milan, Italy, to meet our buddy who has a family cabin in the mountains of north west Italy. There we were met with a story book mountain village surrounded by miles of mountain trails to hike. After a few days we headed off to Switzerland to hike and explore some of the most intense mountain landscapes in the world. Some notable spots are:
  </p>
    <ul>
	<li>Champoluc (Village in Northern Italy)</li>
	<li>Lauterbrunnen</li>
	<li>Plattlehorn (Mountain Near Zermatt)</li>
    </ul>
